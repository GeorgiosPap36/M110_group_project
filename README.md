# Quantum Escape

This repository contains the final group project developed for the master's course "Interactive Systems". The project was developed using **Unity3D** and involves creating a Virtual Reality (VR) game that showcases the concepts learned in the course. 

## Plot
Start your journey as a curious student in a Computer Museum. Drawn to a mysterious Quantum Mechanics exhibit, answer two key questions to unlock a hidden Quantum Computer. But be warnedâ€”touching the device whisks you away to the Quantum Realm! Navigate through puzzles in a world where quantum rules reign, seeking a way back to reality.

You can find more information about the project in the game's [site](https://mariangelapol.github.io/M110_INTERACTIVE_SYSTEMS/).
